  h2.dimmed The herbsman's web framework

  p.
    Jamrock is pretty similar to SvelteKit or NextJS, but it's designed to run entirely on the server,
    some client-side integration is there but don't expect too much yet!

  h3.dimmed Yes, we have pages and routes!

  p They work as expected, you define a page and you'll get a route: so #[code FIXME]
